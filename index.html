            <p style="max-width: 60vw; margin-left: 1vw"> The National Volleyball team of Japan is called "RYUJIN NIPPON" which means "Japanese Dragon God" in Japanese. 
                They parcipated in FIVB Volleyball Men's Nations League and they managed to land on the podium after defeating 
                the world champions, Italy, in five sets in the bronze medal match. Despite them failing to get the gold and 
                silver medal, they showed their immense improvement and growth during their bronze medal match. 
                This is why, I love this team. They are bronze medalists in the match, but for me, they are more than a gold medal in my heart. </p></p>

            <p> This is <u>Tatsunori Otsuka</u>, <b>the outside hitter</b> of the Japan National Volleybal Team.
                His nickname is "Tatsu" which fits his personality because his name sounds so cute. He is the player
                that I admire the most because of his personality and how he plays. Although, I play badminton,
                the moment I watched a video of him playing volleyball, I was so  amazed that he's the reason
                why I started to enjoy watching and occasionally play volleyball.  For me, he is more than simply an athlete; 
                he is an inspiration and a great role model to everyone, especially his team, Ryujin Nippon.</p>
